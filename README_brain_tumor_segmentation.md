## 📌 Overview
This repository contains our research paper and experiments on **3D brain tumor segmentation** using various deep learning architectures:
- **U-Net**
- **nnU-Net**
- **Swin UNETR**

Our work is based on the **BraTS2020 dataset** and aims to evaluate model performance (e.g., Dice score) for medical imaging tasks.
